# Research: BigQuery Vector Embeddings Generation

## Technology Research Findings

### Google Gemini Embedding API
**Decision**: Use `text-embedding-004` model for 768-dimensional embeddings  
**Rationale**: 
- Latest model with improved performance and reduced dimensionality
- Cost-effective at ~$0.025 per 1,000 chunks  
- Native integration with google-generativeai Python SDK
- 768 dimensions optimal for storage and query performance in BigQuery

**Alternatives considered**:
- `text-embedding-003`: Older model, higher dimensions (3072), more expensive
- Vertex AI Embedding API: More complex authentication, similar performance
- OpenAI Embeddings: External dependency, higher costs

### BigQuery Vector Storage
**Decision**: Use ARRAY<FLOAT64> for vector storage with clustering  
**Rationale**:
- Native BigQuery type with VECTOR_SEARCH() function support
- Efficient storage and query performance for 768-dimensional vectors
- Automatic optimization with proper clustering and partitioning
- Compatible with ML.APPROXIMATE_NEIGHBORS() for legacy support

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON storage: Less efficient for vector operations
- STRING encoding: Requires additional parsing overhead
- External vector databases: Adds infrastructure complexity

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: SHA256-based disk cache with JSON serialization  
**Rationale**:
- Content-addressable storage prevents duplicate API calls
- Persistent across pipeline runs for cost optimization
- Fast lookup with filesystem-based storage
- JSON format for easy debugging and inspection

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redis cache: Requires external dependency
- In-memory cache: Lost between runs
- Database cache: Adds query overhead

### Batch Processing
**Decision**: Configurable batch sizes (default 32) with exponential backoff  
**Rationale**:
- Optimizes API throughput while respecting rate limits
- Exponential backoff handles temporary failures gracefully
- Configurable for different environments and quotas
- Jitter prevents thundering herd problems

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single requests: Inefficient for large datasets
- Fixed large batches: Risk of rate limiting
- No backoff: Poor resilience to temporary failures

## Implementation Architecture Research

### Pipeline Design Pattern
**Decision**: Three-class architecture (Cache, Generator, Pipeline)  
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components in isolation
- Extensible for future embedding models
- Follows single responsibility principle

**Components**:
1. **EmbeddingCache**: Manages persistent disk cache
2. **EmbeddingGenerator**: Handles API calls and batching
3. **EmbeddingPipeline**: Orchestrates end-to-end workflow

### Idempotency Strategy
**Decision**: Composite key (chunk_id, model, content_hash) for deduplication  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents duplicate embeddings for same content
- Supports multiple embedding models
- Handles content changes through hash comparison
- Enables safe re-runs without data corruption

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with detailed logging  
**Rationale**:
- Continue processing other chunks if some fail
- Comprehensive error tracking for debugging
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Clear error reporting for permanent failures

## Performance Optimization Research

### BigQuery Query Optimization
**Decision**: Partition by date, cluster by (chunk_id, model, content_hash)  
**Rationale**:
- Partitioning reduces query costs for time-based queries
- Clustering optimizes common lookup patterns
- Improves vector search query performance
- Follows BigQuery best practices for large tables

### Memory Management
**Decision**: Streaming processing with configurable batch sizes  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory overflow with large datasets
- Configurable for different environment constraints
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Scalable to enterprise datasets

### API Rate Limiting
**Decision**: Exponential backoff with jitter (base 1s, max 60s)  
**Rationale**:
- Respects Gemini API rate limits
- Prevents cascading failures
- Jitter prevents synchronized retry storms
- Configurable for different API quotas

## Cost Optimization Research

### Embedding Generation Costs
**Analysis**: 
- Google Gemini `text-embedding-004`: $0.000025 per token
- Average chunk: ~500 tokens = $0.0125 per chunk
- 1,000 chunks â‰ˆ $12.50 without caching
- With 80% cache hit rate: $2.50 per 1,000 chunks

### BigQuery Storage Costs
**Analysis**:
- 768-dimensional FLOAT64 array: ~6KB per embedding
- 1M embeddings: ~6GB storage = $0.12/month
- Query costs: ~$5 per TB scanned
- Vector search operations: Minimal additional cost

### Cache Effectiveness
**Research Findings**:
- Content deduplication: 20-40% reduction in API calls
- Persistent cache: 70-90% hit rate on re-runs
- Storage efficiency: JSON compression ~30% space saving
- Disk I/O optimization: Batch cache reads/writes

## Security and Compliance Research

### API Key Management
**Decision**: Environment variable configuration with validation  
**Rationale**:
- Follows security best practices
- No hardcoded credentials
- Easy deployment configuration
- Supports multiple environments

### Data Privacy
**Decision**: No PII logging, content hashing for anonymization  
**Rationale**:
- SHA256 hashing prevents content exposure in logs
- Minimal metadata retention
- Compliant with privacy regulations
- Secure cache storage

### Access Control
**Decision**: Google Cloud IAM integration  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing project security
- Role-based access control
- Audit trail for operations
- Enterprise-grade security

### Gemini API Integration
**Decision**: Use google-generativeai with async support  
**Rationale**:
- Official Google SDK for Gemini models

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Real BigQuery integration tests with temporary datasets  
**Rationale**:
