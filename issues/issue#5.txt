Preface — Issue #5 (Deterministic Rules & Scoring → gap_metrics)
What: Define deterministic, configurable rules and scoring functions to flag insufficient documentation/metadata across artifact types (Kubernetes, FastAPI, COBOL, IRS, MUMPS). Compute a gap_metrics table with chunk_id, artifact_type, rule_name, passed, confidence (0–1), severity (1–5), suggested_fix.
Why: Transparent, reproducible rubric that powers heat maps and progress views.
Constraints: Config-driven rules; deterministic & idempotent compute; single command to run; store rule version/config hash for traceability.
