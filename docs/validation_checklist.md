# Ruleset Validation Checklist: Quality Assurance Framework

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive validation checklist for gap analysis rulesets, ensuring that rule configurations are syntactically valid, semantically correct, and operationally ready before deployment. The checklist follows a multi-tier validation approach from basic syntax to advanced integration testing.

## Validation Tiers

### Tier 1: Syntax and Schema Validation
Basic structural validation ensuring rules conform to specifications.

### Tier 2: Semantic and Logic Validation  
Business logic validation ensuring rules make operational sense.

### Tier 3: Integration and Performance Validation
System-level validation ensuring rules work correctly in production environment.

## Tier 1: Syntax and Schema Validation

### JSON Schema Compliance

#### ✅ Schema Structure Validation
- [ ] **Rule file validates against `configs/schemas/rule_schema.json`**
  - Required fields present: `rule_name`, `artifact_type`, `description`, `evaluation_sql`
  - Optional fields properly formatted: `confidence_weights`, `severity`, `examples`
  - No extra/unknown fields present

- [ ] **Field Type Validation**
  - `rule_name`: String, lowercase alphanumeric with underscores only
  - `artifact_type`: String, one of: kubernetes, fastapi, cobol, irs, mumps
  - `description`: String, minimum 10 characters, maximum 500 characters
  - `evaluation_sql`: String, contains valid SQL syntax
  - `severity`: Integer 1-5 or null (defaults to 3)

- [ ] **Confidence Weights Validation**
  - All weight values are numbers between 0.0 and 1.0
  - Sum of core weights (field_completeness + content_quality) equals 1.0
  - All required weight keys present: field_completeness, content_quality
  - Penalty weights within valid ranges

#### ✅ YAML Syntax Validation
- [ ] **File Structure**
  - Valid YAML syntax (no parsing errors)
  - Proper indentation (2 or 4 spaces consistently)
  - No tabs mixed with spaces
  - Proper string quoting for special characters

- [ ] **Content Organization**
  - Rules grouped logically by category
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Proper use of YAML lists and dictionaries

### SQL Validation

#### ✅ Evaluation SQL Syntax
- [ ] **Basic SQL Syntax**
  - No syntax errors when parsed by SQL parser
  - Proper use of SELECT, WHERE, CASE statements
  - Correct parentheses and bracket matching
  - Valid column references

- [ ] **BigQuery Compatibility**
  - Uses BigQuery-specific functions correctly (JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR, etc.)
  - No MySQL/PostgreSQL-specific syntax
  - Proper handling of BigQuery data types
  - Compatible with BigQuery standard SQL

- [ ] **Required Input Validation**
  - References expected `metadata` JSON column
  - Returns boolean result (true/false or 1/0)
  - Handles null values appropriately
  - No hardcoded table names (uses parameters)

#### ✅ Template SQL Safety
- [ ] **Security Validation**
  - No SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Proper parameterization of inputs
  - No dynamic SQL construction
  - Safe handling of user input

- [ ] **Performance Considerations**
  - No unnecessarily complex queries
  - Proper use of indexes where applicable
  - Reasonable execution time expectations
  - No Cartesian joins or infinite loops

## Tier 2: Semantic and Logic Validation

### Rule Logic Validation

#### ✅ Business Logic Coherence
- [ ] **Rule Purpose Clarity**
  - Rule description clearly explains what is being validated
  - Rule name matches the validation logic
  - Rule addresses a real documentation gap
  - Rule is actionable (can be fixed by developers)

- [ ] **Evaluation Logic Correctness**
  - SQL logic correctly implements described validation
  - Pass/fail conditions are logically sound
  - Edge cases are handled appropriately
  - No contradictory conditions

- [ ] **Artifact Type Alignment**
  - Rule is appropriate for its declared artifact type
  - Field references match artifact type structure
  - Domain-specific logic is correct
  - No cross-artifact type confusion

#### ✅ Severity and Confidence Mapping
- [ ] **Severity Assignment Logic**
  - Severity level matches impact description
  - Security/compliance rules have appropriate severity (4-5)
  - Cosmetic issues have low severity (1-2)
  - Severity escalation rules are applied correctly

- [ ] **Confidence Weight Rationality**
  - Weights reflect relative importance of components
  - Field completeness weight > 0.5 for required field rules
  - Content quality weight > 0.5 for documentation quality rules
  - Penalty weights appropriate for violation severity

### Cross-Rule Validation

#### ✅ Rule Set Consistency
- [ ] **No Duplicate Rules**
  - No two rules validate exactly the same condition
  - Rule names are unique within artifact type
  - No overlapping validation logic
  - Clear differentiation between similar rules

- [ ] **Coverage Completeness**
  - All major documentation aspects covered
  - No significant gaps in validation coverage
  - Progressive severity levels represented
  - Balance between required and optional validations

- [ ] **Rule Interdependencies**
  - No circular dependencies between rules
  - Proper ordering for dependent validations
  - Clear hierarchy of validation priorities
  - Consistent terminology across related rules

  - All required columns populated correctly
  - Data types match expected formats
  - No data truncation or overflow issues

#### ✅ Idempotency Validation

  - No randomness or time-dependent behavior
  - Consistent results across multiple executions
  - Proper handling of version changes

- [ ] **Overwrite Behavior**
  - Previous results properly replaced
