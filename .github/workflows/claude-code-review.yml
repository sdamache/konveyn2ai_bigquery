            Review this PR for the BigQuery AI Hackathon project following CLAUDE.md protocols:

            **🔥 MANDATORY FILE EDITING POLICY:**
            - Verify: Are existing files being enhanced rather than new files created?
            - Check: Is this following "edit-first, create-last" principle?
            - Flag: Any unnecessary file creation that could be consolidation

            **🧪 DEMO READINESS:**
            - Verify: Real functionality (not mocks) for core BigQuery features
            - Check: Code works for live demo presentation
            - Assess: Integration with BigQuery/Gemini API is functional

            **🎯 ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:**
            - Tier 1: BigQuery Studio/Colab + static HTML viewer components
            - Tier 2: Python CLI/Make targets, Svami orchestrator, Janapada memory
            - Tier 3: BigQuery as system of record (source_metadata, source_embeddings, gap_metrics)

            **🚀 CODE QUALITY:**
            - Python/FastAPI best practices for hackathon speed
            - BigQuery integration patterns and security
            - Make command usage and M1 ingestion workflows
            - Test coverage for functional (not style) requirements

            Focus on functional implementation over perfect code style. Be constructive and hackathon-speed oriented.
